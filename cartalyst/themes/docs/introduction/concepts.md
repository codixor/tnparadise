## Concepts

When developing themes, we set out to tackle a common problem associated with teams. There are often two areas of responsibility when creating your application:

* Developers
* Designers

We love creating packages which are both developer-centric as well as designer-friendly. Separation of concerns is a great strategy.

Backend developers aren't great with design (because let's face it, backend developers would rather just "Twitter Bootstrap" every site they work on).

Frontend designers don't want to tackle with complex PHP code.

For this reason, we wanted to keep all asset handling within views and not in controllers or configuration files.
